# farkle
My girlfiend and I love browsing the half-aisle toy section at Fry's - the Kroger chain here in Arizona. 
One of our trips yielded a purchase of Farkle, "The classic dice-rolling, risk-taking game".
_Describe game_

I was curious about simulating Farkle's complicated scoring rules and needed a reason to practice my Object Oriented Programming skills in python so I figured Farkle would be a good project. 
Here I'll take an OOP approach to playing a round of Farkle, and practice good programming / documentation skills along the way. Maybe I'll even throw in some probability! 

Thanks for looking :)
